# Prehistorics
Game Ironhack Project

## Description
This game has been created as part of the Ironhack Web Development course. 

Prehistorics is a simple canvas-based computer game for a single player. The main character is a caveman who can be moved by left and right arrows on the computer keyboard. The aim is simple, avoid rocks and catch mammoths falling down on the caveman.

After catching 10 mammoths the game is won. The player has only one life.

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
* game has 1 character - caveman
* game has two elements - mammoths and rocks falling down the sky randomly
* the game-over screen appears once the caveman touches a rock
* the winning screen appears once the caveman collects 10 mammoths
* the game has 3 levels - the first level is slow, the second level makes the rocks falling down faster and the third level is even faster
